This is the final JavaScript project from the Odin Project's Web Development 101 course.

The project consists of a fully functional web calculator. This project looks very daunting. Even though I feel really comfortable with my JS skills, I feel like this will take me a while.

However, I feel like I'll be pleased with the end result, as I have been with all my other projects.
